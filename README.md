logIn
=====

<p>LogIn built with Foundation 5. Front validation uses jQuery Validation Plugin inside the CodeIgniter framework.</p><BR>

<p>This program is still being worked on. The front validation http://jqueryvalidation.org/documentation/ works but the Ajax post is giving me problems with CodeIgniter. I will be working on getting it finnished. I found this webside http://www.sitepoint.com/jquery-ajax-validation-remote-rule/ and will be adding the "remote rule" to the plugin.</p>
