<h1>logIn</h1>
=====

Log In built with the Foundation front-end, jQuery Validation Plugin and CodeIgniter.<BR>

<p>The program is still being worked on. The front validation http://jqueryvalidation.org/documentation/ works but the Ajax post is giving me problems with CodeIgniter. I will be working on getting it finnished. I found this webside http://www.sitepoint.com/jquery-ajax-validation-remote-rule/ and will be adding the "remote rule" to the plugin.</p>
